    <h2>Welcome to the Ancient Egyptian Tomb Explorer</h2>
    <p>You stand at the threshold of ancient knowledge, where the secrets of the pharaohs await.</p>
    <p>The digital archives of recently discovered Egyptian tombs have been carefully cataloged by the Ministry of Egyptian Antiquities. Each artifact holds a piece of the past, waiting to be understood.</p>
    <p>The House of Anubis oversees this collection and restricts access to certain sacred artifacts that are deemed too powerful for the uninitiated.</p>
