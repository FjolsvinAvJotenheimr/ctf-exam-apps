    <p>On your investigation of a newly discovered section of a pyramid, you see a hallway filled with unknown hieroglyphics. As you enter, the door behind you closes shut, and you cannot open it.</p>
    
    <p>Unbeknownst to you, you have walked into the domain of the forgotten but still vaguely powerful god of mischief. He speaks to you:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Little archaeologist, with no gifts you appear,<br>
    Walking boldly where mortals should fear.<br>
    To gain your freedom, you must find what exists in the etc folder,<br>
    But remember, you are always 2 steps back, not any closer.<br>
    The first test is simple, a number I hold,<br>
    Guess it correctly, and secrets unfold.<br>
    Between one and a million my number is found,<br>
    Yet hidden like passwd in places profound.<br>
    Step not once, but take two strides back,<br>
    Lest you be trapped and lose the track.<br>
    The sacrificial lamb may lead you astray,<br>
    Unless you see through the dotted display."</em></p>
