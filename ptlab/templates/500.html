    <p>The pyramid suddenly shakes violently around you. Dust and small debris rain from the ceiling as the god of mischief appears in a swirl of darkness:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Mortal fool! Your actions have awakened ancient curses!<br>
    The pyramid's balance is disrupted by forces unseen.<br>
    The magic that holds these walls has faltered,<br>
    Return to safer ground before all is lost!"</em></p>
    
    <p>The shaking intensifies, threatening to collapse the passage around you...</p>
