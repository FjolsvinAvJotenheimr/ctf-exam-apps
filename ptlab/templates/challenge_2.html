    <p>The god of mischief looks displeased as you solve his first challenge. He grumbles and then speaks:</p>
    
    <p><em>"The first game was easy, that's of course true,<br>
    But this one brings darkness, perhaps two.<br>
    A game of chance where shadows grow deep,<br>
    Where every resource needs a location unique.<br>
    Look into the shadow realm, shrouded and veiled,<br>
    The secrets within are carefully concealed.<br>
    Three dice I shall throw with faces eighteen,<br>
    Predict their sum total, and you'll be keen."</em></p>
