    <p>You wander into a dark, unfamiliar corridor of the pyramid. The walls are blank, without hieroglyphics, as if this section was never meant to be found.</p>
    
    <p>A ghostly voice echoes through the empty passage:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Lost traveler, you've strayed from your path,<br>
    This chamber exists not, even in wrath.<br>
    Return to the start and seek the true way,<br>
    For here in the void, you'll forever stay."</em></p>
